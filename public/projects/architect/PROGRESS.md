# Project Status and Future Directions

This document outlines the current state of the "Trading Game" project based on a comprehensive codebase review and suggests potential future development paths.

## Current State of the Project

The "Trading Game" is a substantially developed desktop application built with Electron and React. It successfully simulates a card-based trading environment with the following key characteristics and implemented systems:

*   **Core Architecture**:
    *   A well-defined Electron application structure with a **Main Process** handling backend logic and application lifecycle, and a **Renderer Process** managing the React-based UI.
    *   Secure **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** is established via a preload script (`src/preload/index.ts`) using `contextBridge`, ensuring controlled interaction between the Main and Renderer processes.
*   **Game Logic System**:
    *   A robust two-tiered game logic system resides in the Main Process.
    *   The `GameEngine` (`src/main/game-engine.ts`) orchestrates game sessions, manages the lifecycle of `Game` instances, and broadcasts state updates to the UI.
    *   The `Game` class (`src/core/game.ts`) encapsulates the core rules, state management (game phases, card dealing, player states, market orders/trades), and the primary game loop which includes card reveals and AI actions.
*   **User Interface**:
    *   A React-based UI (`src/renderer/`) provides views for gameplay (`GamePage.tsx`), settings, and other application states, with routing handled by `react-router-dom`.
    *   Styling is managed by Tailwind CSS and UI components from MUI and ShadCN/UI.
*   **AI System**:
    *   An AI system (`src/core/ai/`) allows for multiple AI opponents.
    *   It uses an adapter pattern (`GameAIAdapter`) and a strategy manager (`StrategyManager`) to support different AI behaviors (e.g., `Random`, `MonteCarlo`, `Bayesian`).
    *   Configuration for AI players (number, strategy type) is part of `GameConfig`.
    *   **Current Implementation Note**: While the architecture for sophisticated, pluggable AI strategies is in place (`src/core/ai/strategy-manager.ts`), the `GameAIAdapter` currently utilizes a simpler, inline random strategy. The more advanced strategies (`MonteCarloStrategy`, `BayesianStrategy`) are present as well-developed skeletons with clear intent for more complex logic.
*   **Contract System**:
    *   A flexible contract system (`src/core/contracts/`) allows the game to revolve around different types of tradable instruments whose values are derived from game state (cards).
    *   It features a `ContractAdapter`, `ContractRegistry`, and `ContractFactory` to manage `ContractDefinition`s.
    *   The system supports both **built-in contracts** and **user-defined custom contracts**, which can be created, saved, and loaded through IPC handlers (`src/main/contract-handlers.ts`) and are persisted in a JSON file. This is a powerful and well-implemented feature.
*   **Data Management**:
    *   Key data structures (`GameState`, `GameConfig`, `Card`, `Order`, `Trade`, `ContractDefinition`, etc.) are well-defined in various `types.ts` files, facilitating clear communication between modules.
    *   Configuration (`GameConfig`) is managed and can be updated. Custom contracts are persisted.

**In essence, the project is a functional single-player trading game simulation with a modular and extensible backend architecture and a modern React frontend. The systems for game flow, AI participation, and dynamic contract valuation are largely complete.**

## Potential Future Directions

Based on the current architecture and common game development pathways, here are some potential future directions:

1.  **Full Implementation of Advanced AI Strategies**:
    *   **Action**: Complete the logic for `MonteCarloStrategy` (implementing actual simulations) and `BayesianStrategy` (implementing belief updates and inference). The `GameAIAdapter` in `src/core/ai/game-adapter.ts` would need to be updated to utilize the full `StrategyManager` from `src/core/ai/strategy-manager.ts`.
    *   **Rationale**: This would significantly enhance gameplay depth and AI challenge, leveraging the existing well-designed AI framework.

2.  **Expanded Contract System Capabilities**:
    *   **Action**: Introduce more diverse built-in contract types. Consider allowing more complex user-defined operations or aggregators in the custom contract definition UI, if feasible within the current `BUILT_IN_OPERATIONS` and `BUILT_IN_AGGREGATORS` framework, or extend this framework.
    *   **Rationale**: Further leverages the flexible contract system to offer richer trading scenarios.

3.  **Enhanced User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)**:
    *   **Action**: Develop more sophisticated data visualizations for market activity (e.g., price charts, order book depth charts). Implement a more detailed player portfolio/history view. Improve real-time feedback during trading actions.
    *   **Rationale**: Make the game more engaging and provide players with better tools for analysis and decision-making.

4.  **Comprehensive Testing Suite**:
    *   **Action**: Implement unit tests for core logic in `src/core/` (game rules, AI strategies, contract valuation). Write integration tests for IPC communication and system interactions (e.g., between `GameEngine` and `Game`, or Main and Renderer processes).
    *   **Rationale**: Ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate safer refactoring or feature additions. (No dedicated test files or testing infrastructure were observed during the review).

5.  **Game State Persistence and Scenarios**:
    *   **Action**: Implement functionality to save and load a game in progress (i.e., the full `GameState` and `MarketState`). Introduce predefined game scenarios or challenges with specific starting conditions or objectives.
    *   **Rationale**: Improve player convenience and add replayability. Currently, only `GameConfig` and custom contracts are persisted, not the active game state.

6.  **Refinement of Main Process Globals**:
    *   **Action**: Consider refactoring the use of `global.gameEngine` and `global.mainWindow` in the main process (`src/main/main.ts` and its consumers) to use a more explicit dependency injection pattern, especially if the main process codebase is expected to grow significantly.
    *   **Rationale**: While common in Electron's main process for convenience, explicit passing of dependencies can improve testability and code clarity in very large systems.

7.  **Networking for Multiplayer (Major Feature)**:
    *   **Action**: Architect and implement a networking layer to allow multiple human players to compete. This would involve significant considerations for state synchronization, turn management, and potentially server-side logic or a peer-to-peer model.
    *   **Rationale**: A common and highly impactful feature for trading games, adding competitive and social dimensions. This would be a substantial undertaking.

8.  **Detailed User Documentation**:
    *   **Action**: Create user-facing guides on how to play the game, how to best utilize the custom contract definition features, and perhaps explain the basics of different AI strategies available to play against.
    *   **Rationale**: Improve accessibility and user understanding of the game's depth and features.

These directions range from completing and refining existing features to adding significant new capabilities, offering a broad scope for future development. The current solid architectural foundation should support these expansions well.
