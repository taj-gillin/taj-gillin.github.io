## Abstract

Ferromagnetism and phase transitions are fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics. The Ising Model provides a simplified yet effective framework to study these phenomena by modeling spins on a lattice. This project focuses on a 3D Ising Model and demonstrates the implementation of high-performance parallel computing approaches using **MPI for distributed memory** and **GPUs for acceleration**.

Through careful optimization including shared memory strategies, GPU-aware MPI, and cuRAND-based random number generation, we achieved significant performance improvements with our optimized GPU implementation delivering a **129x speedup** over the serial version while maintaining excellent scaling behavior for large systems.

## Introduction

The Ising model, first proposed by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920 and solved by his student Ernst Ising in 1D, has become one of the most important models in statistical physics. It successfully describes ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transitions and serves as a paradigm for understanding critical phenomena.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate the 3D Ising Model using parallel computing approaches, leveraging MPI for distributed memory and GPUs for acceleration. We aim to:

- Implement and analyze the 3D Ising model below its critical temperature
- Study finite-size scaling effects in large systems  
- Develop efficient parallel algorithms for spin updates and energy calculations
- Compare different optimization strategies for high-performance computing

## Theoretical Framework

The Ising Model represents spins on a lattice, each taking a value of +1 or -1. The system minimizes the Hamiltonian, defined as:

**H = -J ∑⟨i,j⟩ s_i s_j - h ∑_i s_i**

where J is the interaction strength, h is the external magnetic field, and s_i denotes the spin at site i. The notation ⟨i,j⟩ indicates summation over nearest neighbors only.

The energy change for a single spin flip is given by:

**ΔE_i = -s_i(J ∑_nn s_n + h)**

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo methods are essential for studying the 3D Ising model because they provide a way to sample the enormous configuration space efficiently. With 2^N possible states for N spins, direct enumeration becomes impossible for any reasonably sized system.

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm allows us to generate configurations with probability proportional to the Boltzmann distribution exp(-E/k_BT).

## Performance Results

Our optimization journey involved three major breakthroughs:

### Precomputed Random Numbers
- **Problem**: Random number generation consumed ~60% of execution time
- **Solution**: Migrated to cuRAND for GPU-based parallel generation
- **Result**: Reduced to less than 5% of total runtime

### Shared Memory Optimization  
- **Problem**: Frequent global memory access during energy calculations
- **Solution**: Block-level loading and two-level reduction
- **Result**: 0.95s → 0.71s for 64³ lattice (25% improvement)

### GPU-Aware MPI
- **Problem**: Three-step halo exchange process with multiple PCIe transfers
- **Solution**: Direct GPU-to-GPU communication
- **Result**: Final runtime of 0.28s (additional 2.5x improvement)
