      problemStatement: "Traditional educational content can often be static and disengaging. The goal was to explore how Generative AI could be leveraged to quickly transform textual information into dynamic, animated educational videos, making learning more accessible and engaging.",
      approach: "Illuminate was developed as a full-stack application using LangChain to orchestrate LLM calls for script generation and visual element identification. The Manim animation engine was used to programmatically generate video scenes, while a React frontend provided an intuitive user interface. AWS was utilized for hosting and scaling the backend processes.",
      results: "The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using GenAI to automate educational video creation. It was recognized with the Best Use of Gen AI award at Hack@Brown, highlighting its innovative approach and potential impact on educational technology.",
      keyFeatures: [
        "AI-powered script generation for educational content",
        "Automated animation creation using Manim",
        "Interactive quiz generation to test understanding",
        "Real-time video preview and editing capabilities"
      ],
      futurePlans: "Future plans include implementing a chat feature for follow-up questions, refining animations, and experimenting with other LLMs like Claude and Deepseek. The team also aims to make the platform available in multiple languages and target it towards teachers and students.",
